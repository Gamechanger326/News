IT is considered a subset of         information and communications technology (ICT). In 2012, Zuppo proposed an ICT hierarchy where each hierarchy level ,contain some degree of commonality in thatthey are related to technologies that facilitate the transfer of information andvarious types of electronically mediated communications.The term is commonly    used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses  other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones.  Several industries are associated with information technology,including computerhardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment,   and e-commerce. Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and         communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing  in about 3000 BC.
