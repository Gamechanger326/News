Rio Olympics started and ended on a colourful note despite some of the leading stars withdrawing from the competition due to Zika virus. The virus had put a threat to the organisers.Rio Olympics also faced another peculiar situation. During the third day of the water polo event, the water suddenly turned green. The water quality has been a major issue surrounding the Olympics, but in the ocean and lagoons, not pools. Olympic organisers couldn’t explain the colour change although Rio organizers’ spokesman Mario Andrada blamed a proliferation of algae while insisting that the athletes weren’t at risk.
