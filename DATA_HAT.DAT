The Antikythera mechanism,     dating from about the beginning of the first century BC,is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, and the earliest known     geared mechanism. Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the  16th century, and it was not until 1645 thatthe first mechanical calculator     capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed.     Electronic computers, using either relays or valves, began to appear in the     early 1940s. The electromechanical Zuse Z3, completed in 1941, was the world's  first programmable computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines  that could be considered a complete computing machine. Colossus, developed      during the Second World War to decrypt German messages was  the first electronicdigital computer. Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose,     being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to     store its program in memory; programmingwas carried out using plugs and switchesto alter the internal wiring. The first recognisably modern electronic  digital stored-program computer was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine     (SSEM), which ran its first program on 21 June 1948.The development of          transistors in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories allowed a new generation of  computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption.
