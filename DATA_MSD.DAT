What prompted you to step down?
I am somebody who believes that in our set-up, split captaincy doesn’t really   work. With the Indian team, one player leading the players in all the formats is something that is very crucial.
Now that I can’t be the Test captain, I don’t think my views should change.Virat took over the Test captaincy and I wanted him to have some time over there and get into the full captaincy role.You know, limited-overs format is not a big challenge. That’s why I finally decided to move on and give Virat the full captaincy.
Can you talk about your bond with Virat?
We have been very close, right from the start. You know, in Indian cricket, when cricketers get five games, and if they are out of the side, they’re always worried about the two games they didn’t get.Virat was somebody who always wanted to improve in whatever chances he got.He wanted to do well in those games. And that is the reason why he is so successful right now…
