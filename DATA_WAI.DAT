In the 2000s, women have also had leadership roles in computer    companies, such as Meg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HewlettPackard Enterprise and Marissa Mayer, President and CEO of Yahoo! since July    2012 and previously a long-time executive, usability leader,and key spokespersonfor Google.Ada Lovelace was the first person to publish an algorithm intended   to be carried by the first modern computer, the Analytical Engine created by    Charles Babbage. Because of this, she is often regarded as the first computer   programmer,[2][3][4]though this statement, as well as others about Ada's        mathematical abilities and involvement with Babbage's project, has been         criticized.Grace Hopper was the first person to create a compiler for a         Programming language and one of the first programmers of Mark I computer, an    electro-mechanical computer based on Analytical Engine. Adele Goldberg was one  of the seven programmers that developed Smalltalk in 1970's, one of the first   object-oriented programming languages,the base of current Graphic User Interface,that has its roots in 1968's The Mother of All Demos by Douglas Engelbart.     Smalltalk was later used by Apple to launch Apple Lisa in 1983, the first       personal computer with GUI, and one year later its Macintosh. Windows 1.0, basedon the same principles, was launched a few months later in 1985.
