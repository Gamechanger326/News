brushing aside concerns that the expansion would lower the overall standard
of the tournament, and make it too long and unwieldy.

The governing body of football said on its Twitter feed that the FIFA Council,
its decision-making panel, had voted unanimously in favour of the change which
will be introduced at the 2026 tournament.The new format will include
a first round of 16 groups of three teams, FIFA said, with further details
to be given later.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who replaced the disgraced Sepp Blatter
in February, had made World Cup expansion one of his promises during his
successful electoral campaign.Infantino had initially suggested
a 40-team tournament but then added another eight to that total in October.
FIFA's 211 member associations each hold one vote in the presidential
election and 135 of them have never played at a World Cup, so expansion of
the tournament was always likely to appeal.
