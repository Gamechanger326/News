Whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single  established name. We shall call it information technology (IT). Their definitionconsists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of     statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of  higher-order thinking through computer programs.Based on the storage and        processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct   phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC - 1450 AD), mechanical        (1450 - 1840), electromechanical (1840 - 1940), electronic (1940 - present), andmoreover,IT as a service. This article focuses on the most recent period        (electronic), which began in about 1940.
